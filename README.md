The purpose of this exercise was to practice what I learned in Flexbox. I found it to be very tricky, so working my way around it has improved me alot. I don't know what happend but the page will not load. I am moving on to Javacript now, I will get back to this problem later. The page works when I click index.html from my folder but not from github.
